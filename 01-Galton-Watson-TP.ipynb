    "For the first session, we propose to investigate the **Galton-Watson process**.\n",
    "This process was first introduced to analyse the propagation of a feature (family surname, DNA) through generations, and in particular to estimate its probability of extinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Galton-Watson process can be depicted as a (directed) random tree. The nodes represent individuals and the arrows family relations. The tree is built generation by generation as follows. At generation $0$, there is a single individual, the population ancestor, represented by the tree *root*. Then, each individual from a given generation $ i $ gives birth to a random number of individuals at generation $ i+1 $, represented by its direct successors in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unique parameter of the process is the distribution of the number of children per individual.\n",
    "Specifically, we assume that the numbers of children are independent between individuals and\n",
    "drawn from the same distribution $(p_k)_{k\\in \\mathbb{N}}$ (with $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} p_k = 1$).\n",
    "We let $\\mu$ denote the mean number of children per individual, which we assume to be finite:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu =  \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} k p_k <+\\infty.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, in practice, there are multiple ways to explore the tree. We will consider two of them in the pratical:\n",
    "- **Generation by generation**. This is the method we described above. For each $i \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we let $ G_i $ denote the random variable that counts the number of nodes at generation $ i $.\n",
    "- **Active node by active node**. The nodes are visited one by one to decide on their number of children. We keep track of the number of nodes that are *active* in the sense that we have discovered them but we haven't drawn their number of children yet. As long as there is at least one active node, we can perform a *termination* that consists in desactivating a node, drawing its number of children according to the distribution $(p_k)_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$, and adding these children (if any) to the set of active nodes. For each $t \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we let $ X_t $ denote the number of nodes that are active after $ t $ terminations, with the convention that $X_0 = 1$. Observe that $(X_t)_{t \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ defines a Markov process that is similar to a birth-and-death process, except that state $0$ is absorbing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the practical is to play with these two viewpoints in order to better understand the Galton-Watson process. We will focus on two metrics: the **mean population size $\\chi$** and the **extinction probability $P_{ext}$** (i.e., the probability that the population is finite).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to deepen your theoretical knowledge of this process, you can read Chapter 1 from the book [Epidemics and Rumours in Complex Networks][massoulie] (which is **not** mandatory).\n",
